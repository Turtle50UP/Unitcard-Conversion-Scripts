Bad markdown, start! Just follow the format in Examples for the input files to the functions contained in unitDataConverters.py. I have plans to make this more robust with different formats (csv to kkentaro's list, csv to unitcard v1 etc), but goal was to get a working system first, and since I don't do anything too fancy like Kkentaro's cost/skill fields, I'm not comfortable yet trying to convert my nonstandard inputs to something that fancy.
